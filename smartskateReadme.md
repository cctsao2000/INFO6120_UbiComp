### Abstract
SmartSkate is a wearable device for rollerblading/rollerskating beginners to keep track of their practice. By attaching SmartSkate on one of the rollerblade, skaters would be alerted if they are going overspeed or are running into obstacles while skating. Recieving these alert may give beginner skaters more time to react and avoid dangers. 

By connecting a smartphone with the device via Bluetooth, SmartSkate could record the date and time of practicing, average skating speed, total distance, and skating time on a text file, which will allow skaters to review their progress.

This project is a prototype of SmartSkate built using Circuit Python and Circuit Playground.
