            Should you fancy a wristwatch with Snoopy on it, you’re hardly short of options. Timex has an entire collection
            dedicated to the Peanuts gang, Seiko recently issued a breezy duo of Snoopy-adorned tickers, and Bamford London,
            a UK luxury watch brand, has a £1,700 ($2,240) GMT made as a collab with the fashion website Hypebeast,
            featuring the famous pooch styled in streetwear. Or you could just plump for the cute Snoopy watch face Apple
            added to its WatchOS last summer.

            But for Snoopy-powered wrist gear with added red-hot hype credentials, you could try your luck today at selected
            Swatch stores around the world, where the new edition of the MoonSwatch, the brand’s cut-price interpretation of
            Omega’s venerated, astronaut-worn Speedmaster Moonwatch Professional, is dropping.

            It’s exactly two years since the original MoonSwatch collection unleashed a storm of online hysteria, frenzied
            crowds at stores and aftermarket profiteering—it was, to put it mildly, something of a hullabaloo.

            The new version, called the Mission to Moonphase, is looking to restoke the buzz with a design in all-white
            bioceramic (a proprietary compound of bioplastic and ceramic), featuring a lunar display at 2 o’clock in which
            Snoopy reclines on a crescent moon, his sidekick Woodstock on his lap. In low light the moon glows amid a starry
            sky, and an otherwise hidden legend shines out: “I can’t sleep without a night light,” a reference to a 1962
            Peanuts strip in which the dog falls asleep to the light of a full moon.

            On the one hand, this is an if-you-know-you-know hat-tip to Omega lore: The brand, official watchmaker for NASA
            astronauts, was conferred the agency’s Silver Snoopy Award for achievements in mission success in 1970, the
            character having been adopted as a safety mascot the previous decade. Omega’s three modern Speedmaster editions
            featuring Snoopy, created in 2003, 2015, and 2020, are among its most sought-after and collectible watches.

            However, it’s also the latest confirmation of the fact that kitsch characters—cartoons, gaming creations,
            superheroes, anime, etc.—have become huge business in the world of apparel, gear, and even luxury.

            The licensing operations behind IP from Popeye to Miss Piggy are no longer dealing simply in bargain-basement
            merch: They are leveraging designer products for a rising generation of high-end buyers, whose radar for all
            things nostalgic, ironic, and drenched in the sugar coating of pop culture—as opposed to the remote mystique of
            olde worlde luxury—is finely attuned.

            In recent years, for instance, Louis Vuitton has done Mickey Mouse with its Gerald Genta brand, Balenciaga has teamed up
            with Fortnite, and TAG Heuer has put out limited edition Super Mario watches (including a tourbillon in which a tiny
            Mario, adorning the tourbillon’s structure, is chased in a circle by fellow game figures Bullet Bill and the Blue
            Shell).
